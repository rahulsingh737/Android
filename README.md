# Android

I will keep on sharing important snippets related to Android. These snippets worked fine with AppCompatActivity.

1.SharedPreferences (storing small data into device like remember user)

2.Volley Rest request (rest calls)

3.TextInputLayout instead of EditText (better version of EditText)

4.Logging (make a separate class for continuous logs)

5.Crash report (Thread uncaughtExceptionHandler)

6.Splash activity (animation before starting app directly)

7.Bundle put extras (sharing data among different activities)

8.Menu design using XML files on actionbar

9.ActionBar and StatusBar

10.HashMaps for maps

11.JsonObject, JsonArray and JSONParser

12.Designs for a particular element using XML file in drawable

13.List as dialog

14.AsyncTask for performing some tasks like polling in background
